# AI Agent Conversation

A collaborative AI agent system that solves problems through multi-agent conversation between a questioner (Agent A) and an answerer (Agent B).

## Overview

This project implements an iterative conversation between two AI agents to solve problems:
- **Agent A (Questioner)**: Asks questions and guides the problem-solving process using Google's Gemini model
- **Agent B (Answerer)**: Provides answers and solutions using OpenAI's ChatGPT model

The system visualizes the conversation in real-time using Streamlit, with color-coded messages and a clear display of the final solution.
